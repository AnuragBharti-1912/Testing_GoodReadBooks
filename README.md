# Testing_GoodReadBooks

For the provided problem statement, I have employed "search.books" API from Goodreads.com and used "Author" as a parameter to search a book from goodreads.com

Below are the key points:
---------------------------
--I have used Java as my language.
--Maven is used for managing build dependencies.
--TDD framework is used.


Parameters used are:
-----------------------
--'q': Here 'author name' is used in this case.
--'page': I have used 1 and 2 pages in data provider.
--'key': developer key is generated.
--'search[field]': all(default) and 'author' is used in data provider.

For deployment:
----------------
--Unzip the folder and import the project in IDE.
